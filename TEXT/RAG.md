# RAG and FAISS for domain-specific query classification with SME data

### While LLMs excel at generating text and answering general questions, they often struggle with specialized or domain-specific queries. Fine-tuning these models can be challenging due to computational limitations or insufficient data. By using FAISS, we can utilize pretrained embeddings from extensive text corpora to efficiently search and classify custom queries based on subject matter expertise (SME). Reference: [FAISS](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/).

```python
sme_data = {

## Encoding and Inference

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss

# encode the SME data
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(list(sme_data.keys()))

# add our embeddings to the FAISS index
embedding_dim = embeddings.shape[1]  
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_dim) 
index.add(embeddings)  

# queries for testing
queries = ["Hello! I have not logged into my account for months, and I cannot remember my password. Can you help?",
           "How do I file a claim for a motorcycle accident?",
           "Is it possible to reduce the amount of monthly installments for my loan?",
           "Why was my transaction declined when I was trying to pay my loan installment?"]

K = 3 # top-k similar sentences
for query in queries:
    query_embedding = model.encode([query])
    distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding, K)

    print("\nUser Query:", query)
    print("\nTop Retrieved Sentences:")

    similarities = {} # count, sum_distance

    for i in reversed(range(K)):
        sentence = list(sme_data.keys())[indices[0][i]]
        distance = distances[0][i]   
        
        category = sme_data[sentence] 
        print(f"{K-i}: {sentence} - {category} (Distance: {distance:.4f})")
        
        if category not in similarities:
            similarities[category] = [1,distance]
        else:
        
            similarities[category][0] += 1
            similarities[category][1] += distance


    def predict(similarities,method="count"):
        #  if there is an imbalance in the occurences of each category distance provides 
        #  a more robust measure since other categories will be included by default  
        if method == "count":
            return sorted(similarities.items(), key=lambda x: x[1][0], reverse=True)[0][0]
        elif method == "distance":
            return sorted(similarities.items(), key=lambda x: x[1][1], reverse=True)[0][0]

    print("\nPredicted Category:", predict(similarities),"\n")
